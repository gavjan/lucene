The purpose of the tasks is to create applications for searching text in documents. contemporary
operating systems are similar, built-in functionality. Tools developed as part of this task must be oriented 
towards indexing thecontent of popular documents formats (including PDF, not just pure text files). 
However, this would not be another change grep tools the application should "understand" the internal 
function of these documents (thankfully the person implementing the application regarding this knowledge 
structure does not have to; see. Extraction text section from documents below). 
In addition, text search must be fast, also when the document crawler collection is large and 
consists of several hundred or even several thousand files - each time scanning the content of all 
documents for a given job in pattern query will be insufficient here. Hence the need to use 
an index that significantly including the search process.
